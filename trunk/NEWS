1.3.6:
  * Sequence improvements: support for sequences of sequences and
    sequences of enums
  * _narrow() fix.
  * Member sequences stored by value rather than reference, to be CORBA spec-compliant.
  * Removed some reinterpret_casts<>, avoid MI problems.
  * Initialize some member variables.

  * Fix/improvement for _this().
  * MI fix for stubs.
  * Various sequences fixes, fixing #113407.
  * Implemented POA exception classes.
  * Corrected, and unified memory management of Objects, ORB, and POA, fixing #110727.
  * Avoid dereferencing null pointer when throwing exception.
  * reference-count fix for POA.
  * Added some more std:: prefixes for gcc 3.2.
  * Added member typedefs, fixing #109834.
  * Implemented get_buffer() const on SequenceBase, fixing #11033.
  * Avoid dereferncing null pointer in _duplicate and CORBA::is_nil.
  * Implemented get_seq_typename(), fixing most of #108644 and #109212.
  (Bowie Owens) (Yes, all of it).
  * POA init fix, #109659.
  * Removed excess overloading of CORBA::is_nil().
  * Create _var_type typedef in structs
  * Fixed memory leak in CORBA::Object_var.
  * Fixed reference-counting problem in ORB.

  * Others.
  (Gergo Erdi)

1.3.4:
  * Fixed #104528, correcting a "CORBA::Object::Object"
    to "CORBA::Object".
  * Fixed #101809, removing use of "using" keyword,
    so it now builds with gcc 2.9*.
  * Some improved supports for Union types.
    (Gergo Erdi)
