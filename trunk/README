orbitcpp provides a CORBA C++ mapping for ORBit. This version (orbitcpp 2) targets ORBit 2.

August 28, 2011 :

orbitcpp0x is a fork of

  https://svn-archive.gnome.org/svn/orbitcpp/trunk r288
  (latest revision, dated 2008-02-08)

which extends orbitcpp to support the evolving IDL to C++0x mapping.
The code is developed such that the existing CORBA 2.2 based mapping remains
intact, in other words the modifications are made non-destructively.

The new C++0x mapping can be enabled at compile time, by invoking "make" as follows:

  make CXXFLAGS="-DIDL2CPP0X -std=c++0x"
